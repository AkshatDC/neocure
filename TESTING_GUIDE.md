## Test Scenario 8: RAG Pipeline Verification

### Steps:
1. Upload medical document with specific information
   - Example: "Patient allergic to penicillin"
2. Wait for OCR and indexing (check console logs)
3. Ask chatbot: "Am I allergic to any medications?"

### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ Chatbot retrieves relevant chunk from Pinecone
- ‚úÖ Response mentions "penicillin allergy"
- ‚úÖ Context is patient-specific (not generic)

üìÑ Created X text chunks
üßÆ Generating embeddings for X chunks...
‚úÖ Generated X embeddings
üì¶ Upserted batch 1/1
‚úÖ Stored X vectors in Pinecone

```

### Pinecone Verification:
```bash
# Check vector count in Pinecone dashboard
# Should increase after each document upload
```

---

## Test Scenario 9: Search and Filter

### Medical Records:
1. Upload multiple documents with different names
2. Use search bar to filter:
   - Search: "prescription" ‚Üí Shows only prescriptions
   - Search: "lab" ‚Üí Shows only lab reports
3. Click filter button (future enhancement)

### Drug Interaction History:
1. Check multiple drug combinations
2. View history page
3. Filter by severity (CRITICAL, SEVERE, MODERATE)

---

## Test Scenario 10: Error Handling

### Test Cases:

#### Invalid File Upload:

#### Invalid Drug Name:
- Enter gibberish in drug checker
- Expected: Graceful handling, fallback response

#### Expired Token:
- Wait for JWT expiration
- Make API call
- Expected: Redirect to login

---

## Performance Testing

### Load Test:
```bash
# Install Apache Bench
apt-get install apache2-utils

# Test chat endpoint
ab -n 100 -c 10 -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -p chat_payload.json \
  -T application/json \
  http://localhost:4000/api/chat
```

### Expected Performance:
- Chat response: < 3 seconds (with RAG)
- File upload: < 5 seconds (depends on file size)
- OCR processing: < 10 seconds
- Drug interaction check: < 2 seconds

---

## Security Testing

### Test Cases:

#### Authentication:
```bash
# Try accessing protected endpoint without token
curl http://localhost:4000/api/records
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized

# Try with invalid token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid_token" \
  http://localhost:4000/api/records
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized
```

#### Authorization:
```bash
# Patient tries to access another patient's records
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer PATIENT_A_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:4000/api/records?patientId=PATIENT_B_ID
# Expected: 403 Forbidden or empty results
```

#### SQL Injection:
- Try entering SQL in search fields
- Expected: Sanitized, no database errors

#### XSS:
- Try entering `<script>alert('xss')</script>` in chat
- Expected: Escaped, not executed

## Debugging Tips

### Backend Issues:

#### Chatbot returns generic responses:
```bash
# Check OpenAI API key
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# Check Pinecone connection
# Look for "‚úÖ Pinecone index connected" in logs

# Check RAG retrieval
# Look for "üîç Retrieved X relevant chunks" in logs
```

#### OCR not working:
```bash
# Check Cloudinary credentials
echo $CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME

# Check file upload logs
# Look for "üìÑ Processing medical document"
```

#### Drug interactions show fallback:
```bash
# Check Python script path
ls ../drug-interaction-checker/drug-interaction-checker/src/check_interactions.py

# Look for "Python drug checker failed, using fallback" in logs
```

### Frontend Issues:

#### API calls failing:
```javascript
// Check browser console
// Look for CORS errors or 401/403 responses

// Verify API URL
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL)

// Check token
console.log(localStorage.getItem('accessToken'))
```

#### Components not updating:
```javascript
// Check React DevTools
// Verify state updates
// Check useEffect dependencies
```

---

## Automated Testing (Future)

### Unit Tests:
```bash
cd backend
npm run test

# Test coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### E2E Tests (Playwright):
```bash
cd frontend
npx playwright test

# Run specific test
npx playwright test tests/chatbot.spec.ts
```

---

## Test Data Setup

### Sample Users:
```sql
-- Patient
INSERT INTO users (email, password, role, name) VALUES
('patient@test.com', 'hashed_password', 'PATIENT', 'John Doe');

-- Doctor
INSERT INTO users (email, password, role, name) VALUES
('doctor@test.com', 'hashed_password', 'DOCTOR', 'Dr. Jane Smith');
```

### Sample Prescriptions:
```javascript
// Via API or Firebase console
{
  patientId: "patient_id",
  doctorId: "doctor_id",
  drugName: "Lisinopril",
  dosage: "10mg",
  frequency: "Once daily",
  status: "ACTIVE"
}
```

---

## Success Criteria

### ‚úÖ System is fully functional when:
1. Chatbot provides context-aware responses (not repetitive)
2. Medical records upload, store, and display with OCR text
3. Drug interactions are detected and displayed with severity
4. Prescriptions trigger automatic interaction checks
5. Dashboards show real-time data from database
6. Alerts appear for doctors when critical interactions detected
7. RAG pipeline retrieves relevant context from uploaded documents
8. All API endpoints return real data (no mock responses)
9. Frontend components fetch and display live data
10. Error handling prevents crashes and shows user-friendly messages

---

## Reporting Issues

When reporting bugs, include:
1. Steps to reproduce
2. Expected vs actual behavior
3. Browser console logs
4. Backend server logs
5. Network tab (API calls)
6. Environment details (OS, browser, Node version)
